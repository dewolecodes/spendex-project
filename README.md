# Spendex Project

Spendex is an AI-powered personal finance management web application and landing/dashboard demo built with Next.js (App Router). It combines a modern, responsive UI with server-side API endpoints and lightweight AI features to help users track, analyze, and optimize their finances.

## Project type

- AI-enabled frontend web application (Next.js + React) using the App Router.
- Lightweight server/API routes for integrations and data handling located under `src/app/api/`.

## What this project does

Spendex demonstrates a professional finance management experience enhanced by AI capabilities. Key user-facing features include:

- Transaction overview and dashboard visuals.
- AI-assisted insights and recommendations for budgeting and eSpendex reduction.
- Conversational assistant endpoints for financial queries and quick guidance.
- Extensible component-driven UI for rapid experimentation and production hardening.

## Built with

- `Next.js` (App Router) — server and client components, routing, and static asset handling
- `React` — reusable UI components and composition
- `Node.js` / `npm` — runtime and package management
- `PostCSS` — CSS tooling and processing
- Plain/global CSS for layout and component styles (`src/app/globals.css`)

The project also includes static assets under `public/` and modular UI components in `src/components/`.

## Quick start

1. Install dependencies:

```powershell
npm install
```

2. Run the development server:

```powershell
npm run dev
```
